# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to handle invalid user IDs, which can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data based on a user ID. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the user ID is invalid (e.g., not found or improperly formatted).  This can result in errors, such as database errors or unexpected responses to the client.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file addresses this issue by adding error handling to the route handler. It checks for the existence of the user ID and returns an appropriate error response if it is invalid.
